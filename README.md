# gaming_instagram, GameShot

This is my take on a picture sharing web app for gamers to post their screenshots of games, follow other friends/players, 
and see posts of those users whom you follow.  There are many more features I am in the process of implementing, such as
image customization, upvote system and better mobile layout.  It is built in Rails, using gems such as Ransack, Devise,
Paperclip with AWS, and HTTParty (for future features).

To Install: bundle install inside the root directory after downloading, and then start the server
